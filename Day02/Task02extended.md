#### 7. Advanced Item Management
- **Item Inheritance**: Establish a hierarchy of item classes. For example, define base classes such as `Weapon` and `Potion`. `Weapon` could enhance attack capabilities while `Potion` might restore health or magic points.
- **Consumable Items**: Implement consumable items that players can use during their turn in a battle, affecting character states like boosting health or strength for a limited number of turns.

#### 8. Environment Effects
- **Environment Class**: Create classes representing different types of environments (e.g., Forest, Desert, Castle). Each type of environment can influence the game mechanics, such as reducing visibility in a forest which affects accuracy, or a desert increasing exhaustion rates.
- **Dynamic Effects**: Implement methods within the `Environment` class that modify character stats or abilities when they enter these zones. This teaches the use of polymorphism and method overriding based on the environment type.

#### 9. Multiplayer Functionality
- **Turn-Based Mechanics**: Develop a simple turn-based system where two players use the same console. Each player could control one or more characters, taking turns to move and perform actions. This can be managed by looping through a list of `Character` objects and allowing actions in sequence.

#### 10. Character Progression System
- **Character Leveling**: Implement a basic leveling system where characters earn experience for actions like winning battles or performing special tasks. Leveling up could improve their attributes like health, strength, or special abilities.
- **Attribute Enhancement**: Allow players to customize their character's attributes as they level up, adding a strategic layer to the game.

#### 11. Extended Gameplay Mechanics
- **Special Moves**: Further develop the `performSpecialMove()` method in character subclasses. Each character class could have multiple special moves available based on their level or certain items they possess.
- **Battle Mechanics**: Enhance the `Battle` interface to include different types of conflicts, such as ambushes or defensive stands, where players must adapt their strategy based on the scenario.

#### 12. Game Testing
- **Unit Testing**: Focus on writing unit tests for core functionalities like item usage, character leveling, and the battle mechanics. This ensures that each component functions correctly in isolation and when integrated.

### Simplified Implementation
This approach emphasizes direct OOP concepts:
- **Encapsulation**: Manage internal states of characters and items through private fields and public methods.
- **Inheritance**: Use subclasses for character types and items, allowing for shared and unique behaviors.
- **Polymorphism**: Override methods to perform character-specific or item-specific actions.
- **Abstraction**: Use interfaces and abstract classes to define common methods that must be implemented by all subclasses, like those in the `Battle` and `Item` classes.
