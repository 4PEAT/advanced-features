### Task: Develop a Hotel Booking System (Console-Based)

**Objective:** Create a console-based Java application for a hotel booking system. This system should employ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and utilize Java's core features such as abstract classes and methods, interfaces, inner classes, anonymous classes, enumerations, exceptions, generic types, collections, annotations, reflection, and threading to build a comprehensive, text-based interface system.

#### Requirements:

1. **Room and Hotel Structure:**
   - Implement a class hierarchy for different room types (e.g., `StandardRoom`, `Suite`, `DeluxeRoom`) demonstrating inheritance, with abstract classes to outline common attributes and methods.
   - Define interfaces for different room amenities (e.g., `WifiAccessible`, `RoomServiceAvailable`), showcasing polymorphism across varied room types.

2. **Booking and Customer Management:**
   - Design a `Customer` class with private fields for encapsulating customer information and a list of bookings associated with each customer.
   - Use a `Booking` class to represent a reservation, employing generic types to handle booking dates flexibly.

3. **Reservation System:**
   - Utilize collections (e.g., `ArrayList`, `HashMap`) to manage and store room and booking information.
   - Create custom exceptions to address booking errors, such as `RoomNotAvailableException`, enhancing error handling in the system.

4. **Utility Services:**
   - Employ enumerations, such as `RoomStatus`, to represent the status of rooms (e.g., AVAILABLE, OCCUPIED, UNDER_MAINTENANCE).
   - Use inner classes within the hotel management classes for functionalities like booking management, which is specific to the hotel's operational context.
   - Implement anonymous classes for short-lived operations or tasks, like sorting a list of available rooms based on different criteria.

5. **System Operations:**
   - Annotate critical methods to indicate specific actions or checks, using custom annotations where applicable, to simplify maintenance and readability.
   - Apply reflection to perform administrative tasks or debug, like dynamically accessing methods or fields for report generation.

6. **Concurrency in System:**
   - Integrate threading to manage background tasks, such as sending out booking confirmation emails or updating room statuses, with synchronization to prevent data inconsistency.
   - Use `wait` and `notify` within synchronized blocks to manage resource allocation efficiently, such as coordinating room cleaning and availability updates.

7. **User Interface and Interaction:**
   - Develop a text-based user interface in the console for all user interactions, including searching for rooms, making bookings, cancelling reservations, and checking in or out.
   - Ensure the interface handles input errors gracefully, providing clear instructions and feedback to the user for a smooth operational flow.

#### Deliverables:

- Source code for the application, including all Java files organized into packages where appropriate.
- A README file with instructions on compiling, running, and interacting with the hotel booking system, alongside any necessary setup information.
- A brief documentation or comments within the code explaining the design decisions, particularly how OOP principles and Java features were applied to meet the system's requirements.
