### Task 1: Support More Data Types

**Objective:** 
Expand the type support in the `convertValue` method to handle a wider range of data types, enhancing the system's flexibility and capability to manage diverse configuration settings.

**Task Details:**
- **Basic Extension**: Modify the `convertValue` method to safely convert string representations to `double`, `long`, and `float`. These data types should be handled with proper error catching to manage any format exceptions that might occur during the conversion process.
- **Advanced Extension**: Extend support to include the `Date` type. This involves converting date strings (e.g., "2023-04-29") into `Date` objects, using `SimpleDateFormat` for parsing. Proper error handling for date format mismatches is crucial.

### Task 2: Configuration Validation

**Objective:**
Ensure that the configuration values loaded into the system are valid according to predefined rules, which is essential for maintaining the integrity and operational stability of the application.

**Task Details:**
- **Validation Method**: Implement a method in `ConfigurationLoader` that checks the validity of critical configuration parameters post-loading. For example, verify that `maxConnections` is a positive integer and that `databaseUrl` matches a valid URL format.
- **Enhanced Validation Strategy**: Introduce Java annotations to the `AppConfig` class to specify validation rules directly on configuration fields. For instance, annotate `maxConnections` with a custom `@Min(value)` annotation to specify a minimum allowable value, and `databaseUrl` with an `@URL` annotation to enforce valid URL formatting.
- **Annotation Processing**: Adapt the `ConfigurationLoader` to read these annotations from `AppConfig` fields using reflection and perform validations accordingly during the configuration loading process.

These task outlines aim to provide a clear pathway for enhancing the dynamic configuration loader's capabilities, focusing on extending data type handling and ensuring the validity of configuration settings through structured validation mechanisms.
