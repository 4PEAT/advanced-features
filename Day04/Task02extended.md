### Task 1: Support More Data Types

**Objective:** 
Improve the flexibility of the configuration loader by expanding the range of data types it can handle, thus accommodating more complex configuration scenarios.

**Detailed Actions:**
1. **Extend Basic Data Type Support**:
   - **Double, Long, Float**: Enhance the `convertValue` method to include conversions from `String` to `double`, `long`, and `float`. Each conversion should handle any potential `NumberFormatException` to ensure the loader remains robust and error-tolerant.
   - Implement error handling using try-catch blocks to catch conversion errors and provide meaningful error messages or default values in case of exceptions.

2. **Add Support for Date Type**:
   - **Date Conversion**: Implement conversion logic to parse strings into `Date` objects. Since date formats can vary, decide on a standard format (e.g., "yyyy-MM-dd") for your configurations.
   - Use `SimpleDateFormat` for converting the string to a `Date`. Wrap the parsing in a try-catch block to handle `ParseException`, and consider providing a fallback or error message if parsing fails.

**Considerations for Robust Implementation**:
- Ensure that the `convertValue` method clearly logs which type conversion failed if an error occurs, to aid in debugging.
- Consider allowing the configuration file to specify the date format dynamically, which could then be used in the parsing logic.

### Task 2: Configuration Validation

**Objective:** 
Establish a system to validate configuration values once they are loaded, ensuring they meet the defined criteria and thus maintaining the system's integrity and reliability.

**Detailed Actions:**
1. **Implement Validation Logic**:
   - **Method Setup**: Create a new method in `ConfigurationLoader` called `validateConfiguration`. This method should check each critical configuration parameter for validity after it has been set on the `AppConfig` instance.
   - **Specific Validations**: For `maxConnections`, ensure the value is a positive integer. For `databaseUrl`, ensure it conforms to a valid URL pattern. Implement these checks using standard Java functionality, like comparing integer values and using regex for URL validation.

2. **Use Annotations for Declarative Validation Rules**:
   - **Annotation Definitions**: Define custom annotations such as `@Min(value)` for numeric validations and `@URL` for string format validations. These annotations should be able to be placed directly on the fields in `AppConfig`.
   - **Processing Annotations**: Modify the `ConfigurationLoader` to inspect fields of `AppConfig` for these annotations and enforce the constraints during the loading process.
   - **Reflection Utilization**: Use reflection to read annotations from fields and determine if the loaded values meet the criteria specified by these annotations.

**Considerations for Advanced Validation**:
- Ensure that your validation logic is modular and easily extendable as new requirements or data types are introduced.
- Provide detailed error messages that specify which configuration value failed validation and why, which can be crucial for troubleshooting configuration issues in deployment environments.

These detailed actions and considerations aim to provide a structured approach to expanding your configuration loaderâ€™s capabilities, enhancing both its flexibility in handling diverse data types and its robustness through rigorous validation mechanisms.
