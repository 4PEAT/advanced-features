### Task: Develop a Java Program for a Unique Item Tracker

#### Objective:
Create a Java application that tracks unique items in a collection, such as products, books, or any items identified by a unique identifier. The program will allow users to add items to the collection and ensure that no duplicates are added. It will also provide functionality to remove and search for items.

#### Requirements:

1. **Setup:**
   - Java Development Kit (JDK) and any IDE or text editor for writing Java code.

2. **Item Class:**
   - Define an `Item` class with necessary attributes like `id`, `name`, and any other relevant fields.
   - Implement `equals` and `hashCode` methods in the `Item` class to ensure proper functionality when used in a `Set`.

3. **Using Set for Unique Collection:**
   - Use a `Set` (like `HashSet`) to store items. The `Set` ensures that all items in the collection are unique.

4. **Core Functionalities:**
   - **Add Item**: Implement a method to add new items to the set. If an item with the same identifier already exists, it should not be added.
   - **Remove Item**: Implement a method to remove an item by its identifier.
   - **Search Item**: Implement a method to search for an item by its name or other attributes.

5. **User Interface:**
   - Use the console for user input and output.
   - Implement a simple menu system with options to add, remove, and search for items.

6. **Testing:**
   - Test your application with various scenarios to ensure it correctly handles adding, removing, and searching for items.

#### Example Code Structure:

```java
public class Item {
    private String id;
    private String name;
    // Other attributes

    // Constructor, getters, setters, equals, hashCode
}

public class ItemTracker {
    private Set<Item> items;

    public ItemTracker() {
        this.items = new HashSet<>();
    }

    // Methods for addItem, removeItem, searchItem
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Setup and run the item tracker
    }
}
```

#### Evaluation Criteria:
- Correct implementation of the `Set` to ensure uniqueness of items.
- Effective use of object-oriented principles in Java.
- Functionality for adding, removing, and searching items.
- Code quality, including readability, structure, and error handling.
