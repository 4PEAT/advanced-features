### Task: Implement a Contact Management System using Lists in Java

#### Scenario
You are tasked with developing a contact management system for a small business. The system needs to manage a list of contacts, allowing the addition, removal, and search of contact details. To efficiently manage these contacts, you decide to use a list from Java's Collections Framework.

#### Task Description
**1. Create a Contact Class:**
   - Define a class `Contact` with attributes such as `name`, `email`, and `phoneNumber`. You can also include additional relevant attributes like `address` or `company`.
   - Implement constructors, getters, and setters for the class.

**2. Implement the Contact List:**
   - Use a `List` implementation (such as `ArrayList` or `LinkedList`) to create a collection that holds `Contact` objects.
   - Ensure methods are in place to add, remove, and update contacts in the list.

**3. Adding, Removing, and Updating Contacts:**
   - Create methods to add a new `Contact` to the list, ensuring no duplicates based on a unique attribute like email or phone number.
   - Create methods to remove and update a `Contact` based on a unique identifier.

**4. Searching for Contacts:**
   - Implement a method to search for a contact by name. The method should return a list of contacts that match the name.
   - Optionally, implement additional search methods, such as searching by email or company.

**5. Displaying All Contacts:**
   - Create a method to display all contacts in the list with their details.

#### Additional Challenges (Optional)
**1. Implement Sorting Functionality:**
   - Add functionality to sort the contact list by name, email, or other attributes.

**2. Advanced Search Capabilities:**
   - Implement an advanced search method that allows for searching by multiple criteria (e.g., name and company).

**3. Import and Export Contacts:**
   - Extend the system to include the ability to import contacts from and export contacts to a file (e.g., CSV format).

This task involves object-oriented programming, using lists, and system design. It's a practical scenario to apply Java's list data structures and enhance your problem-solving and software development skills.
