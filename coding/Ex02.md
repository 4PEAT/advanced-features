### Task: Develop a Console-Based E-commerce Platform with User Authentication

#### Objective:
Create a console-based Java application for an e-commerce platform. The system should allow users to register, log in, manage products, and purchase items. Users must log in to perform actions on the platform.

### Requirements:

#### 1. User and Product Classes:

1. **User Class**:
   - Attributes:
     - `username`: String
     - `password`: String
     - `loggedIn`: boolean
     - `purchasedProducts`: Set<String>
   - Methods:
     - `getUsername()`: returns the username
     - `getPassword()`: returns the password
     - `isLoggedIn()`: returns the login status
     - `setLoggedIn(boolean)`: sets the login status
     - `getPurchasedProducts()`: returns the set of purchased products
     - `addPurchasedProduct(String productId)`: adds a product ID to the user's purchased products

2. **Product Class**:
   - Attributes:
     - `productId`: String
     - `name`: String
     - `price`: double
     - `stock`: int
   - Methods:
     - `getProductId()`: returns the product ID
     - `getName()`: returns the product name
     - `getPrice()`: returns the product price
     - `getStock()`: returns the stock quantity
     - `reduceStock(int quantity)`: reduces the stock by the given quantity

#### 2. E-commercePlatform Class:

1. **Attributes**:
   - `users`: Map<String, User>
   - `products`: Map<String, Product>
   - `loggedInUser`: User

2. **Methods**:
   - `addUser(String username, String password)`: Registers a new user
   - `deleteUser(String username)`: Deletes an existing user
   - `loginUser(String username, String password)`: Logs in a user
   - `logoutUser()`: Logs out the current user
   - `addProduct(String productId, String name, double price, int stock)`: Adds a new product
   - `deleteProduct(String productId)`: Deletes an existing product
   - `listProducts()`: Lists all available products
   - `purchaseProduct(String productId, int quantity)`: Purchases a product
   - `getProducts()`: Returns all products
   - `getUsers()`: Returns all users
   - `getLoggedInUser()`: Returns the currently logged-in user

#### 3. Console-Based User Interface:

1. **Menu Options**:
   - Register User
   - Delete User
   - Login
   - Logout
   - Add Product
   - Delete Product
   - List Products
   - Purchase Product
   - Exit

2. **Action Prompts**:
   - Prompt the user for input to execute actions
   - Ensure users are logged in to purchase products

### Workflow

1. **User Registration**:
   - User enters a username and password to register.
   - `addUser` method is called to create a new User object and store it in the `users` map.

2. **User Login**:
   - User enters a username and password to log in.
   - `loginUser` method verifies the credentials and sets the `loggedIn` status to true for the User object.

3. **Adding a Product**:
   - Admin user enters product ID, name, price, and stock to add a product.
   - `addProduct` method creates a new Product object and stores it in the `products` map.

4. **Deleting a Product**:
   - Admin user enters product ID to delete a product.
   - `deleteProduct` method removes the Product object from the `products` map.

5. **Listing Products**:
   - User selects the option to list products.
   - `listProducts` method retrieves and prints all available products.

6. **Purchasing a Product**:
   - Logged-in user enters product ID and quantity to purchase a product.
   - `purchaseProduct` method reduces the stock of the product and adds it to the user's purchased products.

7. **User Logout**:
   - Logged-in user logs out.
   - `logoutUser` method sets the `loggedIn` status to false for the User object and clears the `loggedInUser` attribute.

### Console Menu

```
1. Register User
2. Delete User
3. Login
4. Logout
5. Add Product
6. Delete Product
7. List Products
8. Purchase Product
9. Exit
```

### Console-Based Interaction

- The main menu displays options for the user to select.
- Based on the user's choice, corresponding methods are called to perform actions.
- Users need to log in to purchase products. Admin actions like adding or deleting products may be restricted based on the user's role (not implemented in this task but can be added).
