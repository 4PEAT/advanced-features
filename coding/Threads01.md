### Task Description:

Write a program that simulates a real-time stock trading system. The system stores current stock prices for various companies, which are continuously read by multiple user threads and updated by multiple trading bot threads.

**Requirements:**

1. **Reading Stock Prices**: 
   - Implement multiple user threads that continuously read the current stock prices.
   - Each user thread should read the prices at random intervals and print the results to the console.

2. **Updating Stock Prices**: 
   - Implement multiple trading bot threads that update the stock prices.
   - Each trading bot thread should fetch the current stock price, wait a random amount of time, and then attempt to update the price with a new random value.
   - The system must verify that the trading bot has the most recent stock price before applying the update. If the stock price has changed since the bot last read it, the update is rejected.

3. **Concurrency Control**:
   - Use synchronized methods to ensure that updates are only applied if the stock prices have not changed since the trading bot last read them.


### Explanation:

1. **StockMarket Class**:
   - Manages stock prices with a `HashMap`.
   - Provides synchronized methods (`getPrices` and `updatePrice`) to ensure thread safety when accessing or modifying the stock prices.

2. **User Class**:
   - Simulates a user reading stock prices at random intervals.
   - Continuously reads and prints the current stock prices.

3. **TradingBot Class**:
   - Simulates a trading bot that updates stock prices.
   - Reads the current price, waits a random amount of time, and attempts to update the price.
   - If the price has changed since the bot last read it, the update is rejected.

4. **RealTimeStockTrading Class**:
   - Initializes the `StockMarket` and starts multiple user and trading bot threads.
