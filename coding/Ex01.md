### Task: Develop a Console-Based Social Media Platform with User Login

#### Objective:
Create a console-based Java application for a social media platform that includes user login functionality. The system should manage users and posts, requiring users to log in to perform actions.

### Requirements:

#### 1. User and Post Structure:

1. **User Class**:
   - Attributes: `username`, `password`, `loggedIn`, `postIds`, `followers`.
   - Methods: `getUsername()`, `getPassword()`, `isLoggedIn()`, `setLoggedIn(boolean)`, `getPostIds()`, `getFollowers()`, `addPost(String)`, `addFollower(String)`, `removeFollower(String)`.

2. **Post Class**:
   - Attributes: `postId`, `content`, `author`.
   - Methods: `getPostId()`, `getContent()`, `getAuthor()`.

#### 2. Platform Management:

1. **SocialMediaPlatform Class**:
   - Attributes: `users` (Map), `posts` (Map), `loggedInUser`.
   - Methods:
     - `addUser(String username, String password)`: Register a new user.
     - `deleteUser(String username)`: Delete an existing user.
     - `loginUser(String username, String password)`: Log in a user.
     - `logoutUser()`: Log out the current user.
     - `addPost(String postId, String content, String author)`: Add a new post.
     - `deletePost(String postId)`: Delete an existing post.
     - `listPostsByUser(String username)`: List all posts by a specific user.
     - `followUser(String follower, String followee)`: Follow another user.
     - `unfollowUser(String follower, String followee)`: Unfollow a user.
     - `getPosts()`: Get all posts.
     - `getUsers()`: Get all users.
     - `getLoggedInUser()`: Get the currently logged-in user.

#### 3. User Interface and Interaction:

1. **Console-Based Interface**:
   - Display a main menu with options for user registration, login, logout, adding posts, deleting posts, listing posts by user, following users, unfollowing users, and exiting the application.
   - Prompt users for input to execute these actions.
   - Ensure users are logged in to add/delete posts, follow/unfollow users.

#### 4. System Operations:

1. **User Registration and Authentication**:
   - Allow users to register with a username and password.
   - Ensure passwords are checked during login.
   - Maintain login status and ensure users can only perform actions when logged in.

2. **Post Management**:
   - Allow logged-in users to add and delete posts.
   - List all posts by a specific user.

3. **Following and Unfollowing**:
   - Allow logged-in users to follow and unfollow other users.

4. **Data Storage**:
   - Use `HashMap` to manage and store user and post information efficiently.

5. **Input Validation**:
   - Validate user inputs for all operations and handle errors gracefully.

#### 5. Testing and Debugging:

1. **Testing**:
   - Test all functionalities to ensure correctness.
   - Debug any issues that arise.

### Deliverables:
- Source code for the application, including all Java files.
- A README file with instructions on compiling, running, and interacting with the social media platform.
