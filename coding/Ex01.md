### Task: Develop a Console-Based Social Media Platform with HashMap Operations

#### Objective:
Create a simple console-based Java application for a social media platform. The system should employ basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and heavily utilize `HashMap` for data management, focusing on efficient operations such as user and post management.

### Requirements:

#### 1. User and Post Structure:

1. **Classes and Interfaces**:
   - Implement a `User` class with attributes like `username`, a list of post IDs, and a list of followers.
   - Implement a `Post` class with attributes like `postId`, `content`, and `author`.

#### 2. Post and User Management:

1. **User Class**:
   - Design a `User` class to encapsulate user information and manage user posts.

2. **Post Class**:
   - Implement a `Post` class to represent a social media post.

#### 3. Interaction and Engagement:

1. **Collections**:
   - Utilize `HashMap` to manage and store user and post information efficiently.
   - Create a `HashMap<String, User>` for user management, where the key is the username.
   - Create a `HashMap<String, Post>` for post management, where the key is the post ID.

2. **Basic Operations**:
   - Add, retrieve, and delete users.
   - Add, retrieve, and delete posts.
   - List all posts of a user.
   - Allow users to follow each other using `HashMap<String, Set<String>>` to store followers.

#### 4. System Operations:

1. **Basic HashMap Operations**:
   - Implement methods to add, retrieve, and delete users using `HashMap<String, User>`.
   - Implement methods to add, retrieve, and delete posts using `HashMap<String, Post>`.
   - Implement methods to list all posts of a user.
   - Implement methods for users to follow/unfollow each other using `HashMap<String, Set<String>>`.

#### 5. User Interface and Interaction:

1. **Console-Based Interface**:
   - Develop a simple text-based interface for user interactions.
   - Handle user inputs for various operations.
   - Display appropriate messages for successful operations and errors.

#### 6. Testing and Debugging:

1. **Testing**:
   - Test all functionalities to ensure correctness.
   - Debug any issues that arise.

### Deliverables:
- Source code for the application, including all Java files.
- A README file with instructions on compiling, running, and interacting with the social media platform.
